My name is Alper Sünter. I am a lifetime student of scientific YouTube channels. It is important for me to understand the intuition behind the mathematics and science. From Mathologer to Numberphile, from Veritasium to Physics Girl, from Electroboom to standupmaths, from Steve Mould to Destin Sandler… That list does not have an end. They taught me incredible stuff. That is so valuable for me. I always felt that one day I will create my own content so that I can make some other one feel the excitement I have with contents from those channels. That day has come, I believe. I was born in November 1999 and hope to have at least a few videos before I turn into 20.

### Why is it called “is not sorcery”?
When I was a little kid, I was crazy about that French TV show called “C’est pas sorcier”. It must be the same period that I was also crazy for “Il était une fois…” series. They have the privilege to be the very first science shows that I watched. The name of this website is, therefore, coming directly from the English translation of the former. C’est pas sorcier (It is not sorcery)

Would I get into any legal troubles? Not sure. Until then, this is the name I would love to use.

### What about this?

He is my imaginary chameleon Cüneyt. Since he can adapt to and survive in any environment (in his case by changing color of course), his name is inspired from movie hero Cüneyt Arkın. *Cuneyt the Chameleon* is our mascot here!
